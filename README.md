# Career Changer Syllabus

## What?

This is my half-arsed attempt at producing an ['unofficial' syllabus](https://github.com/will-gant/career-changer-syllabus/blob/main/syllabus.md) for anyone who has _not_ done a computer science degree and is:
* Considering pursuing some training to become a software engineer (i.e. self-study, a software development 'bootcamp', etc)
* Has already done that training
* Is relatively early in their new career

## Why?

I started writing this for a friend who was considering changing careers and going down the bootcamp route. Within a few months, a second friend expressed a similar interest and so I shared the same document with them.

My goal is to highlight some of the most important topics that I _wish_ I'd known more about earlier on in my studies and my career. Many of the topics I include are neglected entirely by software bootcamps (and even, I'm reliably informed, computer science degree courses). And I find much of the free training material you find online either goes fully overboard (recommending investing thousands of hours in a bottom-up, academic study of computing) or skips these topics outright.

By contrast, my intention is to equip people with the _minimum_ knowledge that I regard as necessary to accelerate their learning and get them on the path to bein proficient engineers.

### Feedback

Do feel free to open an issue if you spot something that's incorrect or misleading, or if I've omitted an important topic you think ought to be covered. Since I haven't pursued any formal study of computer science myself, I'm particularly keen/nervous about getting suggestions for that section!
