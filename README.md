## What?

This is my half-arsed attempt at producing an ['unofficial' syllabus](./syllabus.html) for anyone who has _not_ done a computer science degree and is:
* Considering pursuing some training to become a software engineer (i.e. self-study, a software development 'bootcamp', etc)
* Has already done that training
* Is relatively early in their new career

I use the ruby programming language to introduce many software development concepts. Although its popularity has been declining for some years, it is still very much used in anger across the tech sector (e.g. by AirBnB, Shopify, GitHub). More importantly, its friendly syntax makes it probably the easiest language for beginners to learn. It's also the language _I_ currently work in.

## Why?

I started writing this for a friend who was considering changing careers and going down the bootcamp route. Within a few months, a second friend expressed a similar interest and so I shared the same document with them.

My goal is to highlight some of the most important topics that I _wish_ I'd known more about earlier on in my studies and my career. Many of the topics I include are neglected entirely by software bootcamps (and even, I'm reliably informed, computer science degree courses). And I find much of the free training material you find online either goes fully overboard (recommending investing thousands of hours in a bottom-up, academic study of computing) or skips these topics outright.

By contrast, my intention is to equip people with the _minimum_ knowledge that I regard as necessary to accelerate their learning and get them on the path to bein proficient engineers.

### Feedback

Do feel free to open an issue if you spot something that's incorrect or misleading, or if I've omitted an important topic you think ought to be covered. Since I haven't pursued any formal study of computer science myself, I'm particularly keen/nervous about getting suggestions for that section!
